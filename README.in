What is Interactive Brokers?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the page "`About The Interactive Brokers Group`__":

  Interactive Brokers conducts its broker/dealer and proprietary trading
  businesses on 60 market centers worldwide. In its broker dealer agency
  business, IB provides direct access ("on line") trade execution and
  clearing services to institutional and professional traders for a wide
  variety of electronically traded products including options, futures,

  6,500 different electronically traded products. Interactive Brokers
  Group and its affiliates now trade 19% of the world’s exchange traded
  equity options*, and executes approximately 500,000 trades per day.


What is Python?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the page "`What is Python?`__":

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
  language.  It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.

  Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has
  modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and
  dynamic typing.  There are interfaces to many system calls and
  libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
  Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python
  is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a
  programmable interface.

  The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX,
  on Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system isn't
  listed here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for
  it. Ask around on comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python
  yourself.

  The Python implementation is copyrighted but freely usable and distributable,
  even for commercial use.


What Else?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IbPy is not a product of Interactive Brokers, nor am I affiliated with
IB.  I am a satisfied IB customer, of course.
